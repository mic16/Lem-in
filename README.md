# Lem-in
An AI project where ants chose the fastest way to get to their destination

How to use the program:
1. type make in a terminal in the repository
2. type ./lemin < "file name". There is already a file named "test" but you can create your own if you want. The first number is the number of ants in the initial "box". Then you have the different boxes with the first number being their ID and the other two numbers being their coordinates. And at last you have the connections between boxes. Note: you have to put ##start when you want to make boxes and you have to put ##end right before the last box's ID and coordinates. The connections are made with the first box's ID then a '-' and at last the second box's ID. You can create comments with putting a '#' before writing your comment in the file.
3. Enjoy!
